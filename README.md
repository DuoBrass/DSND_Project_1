## Project 1: A RandomForest Classification For Diabetes**

**Project Motivation**\
Diabetes is a prevalent helath condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to build our knowledge of early detection of _increased risk_ in diabetes and build upon the knowledge currently avaialable in the scientific community.
The goal is to analyze patterns in the data, optimize model performance and provide meaningful insights in diabetes prediction

**Libraries Used**
* Pandas - for potential data manipulation and analysis
* Numpy - for fast numerical computations
* Matplotlib - for data visualisations
* Sklearn - core machine learning library for training, tuning and testing the random forest model

**Files in the Repository**
* diabetes.csv - the raw data donwloaded from Kaggle
* Code for RF on diabetes.ipynb - the jupyter notebook for all the code written for the project
* README.md - Documentation/Metadata for deeper understanding into the project

**Summary of Results**\
The Summary of Results are as followed:
* Un-tuned RF model accuracy of 75%
* Tuned RF model accuracy of 79%
* Tuned RF had a confusion matrix of 33 TP, 88 TN, 23 FN and 10 FP
* Tuned RF model recall of 59%
* Most important variable associated with Diabetes was Glucose Level, followed by BMI, Age, DPF, Pregnancies, Blood Pressure, Insulin and finally Skin Thickness.
